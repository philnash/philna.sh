Phil Nash is a developer evangelist for [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com). Sometimes he [writes code on stage](http://lanyrd.com/profile/philnash/) in front of a crowd, praying inside that everything works. Sometimes [he writes open source code](https://github.com/philnash/), which is much less stressful because if it is wrong someone else can correct it. He writes code in [tweets](https://twitter.com/philnash) sometimes, but not much fits. He blogs [here](/blog/) and on the [Twilio blog](https://www.twilio.com/blog/author/phil) and you'll find plenty of code there too.
