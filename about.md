Phil Nash is a developer evangelist. Sometimes he
[writes code on stage](http://lanyrd.com/profile/philnash/) in front of a crowd,
praying inside that everything works. Sometimes
[he writes open source code](https://github.com/philnash/), which is much less
stressful because if it is wrong someone else can correct it. He writes code in
[tweets](https://twitter.com/philnash) sometimes, but not much fits. He blogs
[here](/blog/) and has done on the
[Twilio blog](https://www.twilio.com/blog/author/phil) and you'll find plenty of
code there too.
